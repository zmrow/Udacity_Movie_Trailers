# Udacity Movie Trailers
Udacity Movie Trailers creates an awesome media center page containing links to the trailers of all your favorite movies!

Udacity_Movie_Trailers is a project from the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.  It is meant to establish a foundation in OO programming by creating a class "Movies", instantiating mutiple instances of said class, and generating a web page of movie trailers.  Awesome!!

## Quick start

Pretty simple:

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/zmrow/Udacity_Movie_Trailers.git`
- Edit the `entertainment_center.py` script and include your favorite movies (if desired)
- Run `python entertainment_center.py` and watch your movie page appear with trailers embedded!!  It is worth it to mention that running this file will create an entertainment_center.html file that you can later re-open to view the page again.

## What's what

The repo contains multiple files:

- `entertainment_center.py`: This is the main executable python file.  It contains the definition of the movie objects that will appear on the main trailers page.  It also calls the freshtomatoes library, which creates the page and opens your default web browser.

- `media.py`: This is the module file that defines the class `Movies`.

- `fresh_tomatoes.py`: This file is supplied by Udacity and contains the functions that generate the actual web page.
